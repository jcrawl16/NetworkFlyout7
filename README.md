# NetworkFlyout7
A faithful and functional remake of the Windows 7 network flyout.

IMPORTANT: There are many issues with this at the moment.
It would be much appreciated if anybody could help me solve major problems with it.

CURRENT ISSUES:
It cannot connect to networks that the user has not connected to before on their PC. It produces the error "Cannot create network profile."
