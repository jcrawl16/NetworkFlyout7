# NetworkFlyout7
A faithful and functional remake of the Windows 7 network flyout.

IMPORTANT: There are many issues with this at the moment, many people cannot even get it to open.
It would be much appreciated if anybody could help me solve major problems with it.

CURRENT ISSUES:
Many people cannot get the flyout to even display properly, when opened, it only displays as a small empty box for some people.
For myself, it is functional and displays properly yet it cannot connect to networks that the user has not connected to before on their PC. It produces the error "Cannot create network profile."
